<p><strong>Study title</strong>: Nexus User Testing</p>

<p><strong>Researcher details</strong>: Dr Scott Hale, Senior Data Scientist, Oxford Internet Institute</p>

<p><strong>Purpose of study</strong>: We will ask you questions about a network diagram in order to understand how easy different visualizations are to comprehend.</p>

<p>In this task you will be given a quick introduction to reading network diagrams and then asked <strong>18 questions</strong> about such network diagrams (the main visualization is of commuting patterns by train in the United Kingdom). The introduction will prepare you to answer these questions correctly, and we will pay you a <strong>bonus of £0.075 for each correct answer</strong> in addition to the base payment of £0.50. This means you could <strong>recieve up to £1.85</strong> for participating. Finally, we will ask a small number of questions about your background. The task should take approximately 6 minutes.</p>
